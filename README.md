# red-brick

An automated investment fund designed to provide universal basic income through compound growth.

## The Concept

**Red-brick** is a community-funded investment pool that grows over decades to eventually provide monthly basic income to participants. The system works on a simple principle: **invest contributions, distribute returns sustainably**.

## How It Works

- **Contributors** add money to build the fund
- **Fund managers** invest in diversified portfolios (targeting 7% annual returns)
- **Recipients** receive monthly payments once the fund reaches sufficient size
- **Sustainability** is maintained by paying out less than the fund generates

The key insight: *As long as annual distributions stay below investment returns, the fund grows indefinitely while supporting more people each year.*

## Vision & Scale

Starting with $1M and 7% annual returns, the fund could theoretically grow to support:

| Timeframe | Fund Size | People Supported | Monthly Payment |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Year 25   | $6.5M     | 18               | $1,900          |
| Year 100  | $500M     | 800              | $3,000          |
| Year 200  | $45B      | 60,000           | $3,000          |
| Year 300  | $800B     | 1,200,000        | $3,000          |

## Phase 1: Establish proof of concept (First 25 years)

| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | $1M          | $70K          | 0      | $0             | $0               | +$70K      |
| 5    | $1.4M        | $98K          | 3      | $1,500         | $54K             | +$44K      |

## Phase 2: Support neighborhoods (Years 25-100)
