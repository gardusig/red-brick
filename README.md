# red-brick

An automated investment fund designed to provide universal basic income through compound growth.

## The Concept

**Red-brick** is a community-funded investment pool that grows over decades to eventually provide monthly basic income to participants. The system works on a simple principle: **invest contributions, distribute returns sustainably**.

*As long as annual distributions stay below investment returns, the fund grows indefinitely while supporting more people each year.*

## Fund exponential growth

Starting with $1M and 7% annual returns, the fund could theoretically grow to support:

| Year | Fund Balance | Annual Return (≈7%) | People (2ⁿ) | Monthly donation per person |
